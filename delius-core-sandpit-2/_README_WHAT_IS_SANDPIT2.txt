This is an almost identical clone of sandpit and is required to facilitate the 'virtual vpc' for SPG purposes.
It basically shares the same properties as sandpit, except for the DNS zones.

All values have been retained incase other components want/need another sandpit environment and to follow the same pattern

At a later stage, it may be possible to remove this environment folder.
