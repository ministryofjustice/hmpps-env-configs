# OVER RIDE COMMON BOILER PLATE VARS

# setting an override similar to that used in delius-mis-test.
# Did not consider this would be necessary for this environment as it's using the updated terraform code as deployed in pre-prod and prod.
# However trying to build this environment has exposed a difference between PROD envs and NON-PROD envs in that the variable
# TG_SHORT_ENVIRONMENT_IDENTIFIER
# has been modified specifically for PROD envs in the "common-prod/common.properties" file to ommit the "${TG_BUSINESS_UNIT}-" thus decreasing the load balencers names by six chars.
# See
# 77dd856#diff-8bfceee7b74b126a4c34b91cd051ecd3
# Removed tf and business unit from short name as we have an issue with lb name length
